# Violent_Python_Py3
Programs from Violent Python text based in Python 2 converted to Python 3 organized by chapter

Projects completed based on TJ O'Connor's (2012) text, "Violent Python A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers".

O'Connor's text is based in Python2, each program has been converted to Python3 and contains a short desciption of the program's function.

Thank you!
